## Disclaimer
No support will be provided for these versions by **me** or by **[meteordevelopment](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment)**, as these are *old* and *outdated* versions of the client.

If you wish to use the latest version of Meteor Client on older server versions, get [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus).

If you wish to use the latest version of Meteor Client on older versions of the game, you will have to build it yourself.
